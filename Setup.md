# START HERE

This is your starting point on your path to doing some frontend development.

Frontend development, as with any development, is very wide. This course is going to teach the CORE basics.

As with anything, if you develop solid core understanding, you're more versitile and setup for success.

You will probably hear and see things you're not familiar with. That's fine. Just go with it.

Some things will make sense as you see them in use. And once you have some basics down, you can then start to dive deeper.

Before we begin, let's get your computer ready for development.

## OS

You can use Linux, Windows or Mac. While I'm a Linux guy, I encourage you to use whatever computer you're most familiar with.

The key to learning is to focus on only what you need to learn. Trying to learn a new OS and other things on top of frontend development will just muddy the water and cause you to learn slower.

Learn the basics of frontend development and then go explore.

## IDE

The IDE (integrated development environment) is a program where you'll write your code. For this course, I'm recommending my favorite tool, which happens to be free:

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Go and install this now.

Open up Visual Studio Code (called VSC from now on).

If you don't see a terminal on the bottom of the screen, use the keyboard shortcut: CTRL + ~ to make it appear.


## GIT

GIT is a way for you to save your code. I won't be going into GIT here, but we will be using it.

1. Open a terminal on your machine and type in:

```
git --version
```

If git is installed, you should see something like:

```
git version 2.20.1
```

The number might be different, but that's ok.

If you don't see anything or your computer is telling you GIT isn't installed, command not found, etc, you need to install it.

Go here & follow the download instructions: [INSTALL GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## NODEJS

Next, you need to install NodeJS (and NPM).

First, let's make sure they aren't installed on your machine.

Open your terminal and type:

```
node -v
```

If it's installed, you'll see something like:

```
v14.4.0
```

To install NodeJS & NPM, go to this page: [NodeJS Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Under the **LTS** tab on top, which should be selected by default, you can select the download for your operating system.

For example, if you're on a Mac, you'd click on the "macOS Installer."

After downloading, running and following all the instructions, open up a terminal again and type in:

```
node -v
```

You should now see a version number.

## Browser

In a dev job, you'll use all the browsers normally, but since we're learning, we just need 1.

My favorite is **FireFox**, but feel free to use your browser of choice.

The main thing is you'll need to know how to get to the developer tools for the browser. Usually this is simple, but in Safari, there's an extra step required.

And this is your first test as a developer. I'm not going to tell you how to open the developer tools for your browser.

Use DuckDuckGo.com or the search engine of your choice to figure it out.

If you fail at this step, you're not ready to proceed.

Once you've succeeded with this step, proceed.
